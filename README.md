## Detailed project description

OzuWiki is a project that aims to provide the latest information on Ã–zyeÄŸin University to the web, free of charge.

All of the articles on the site are made up of student contributions, where students can submit new article and edit existing ones. All submissions are reviewed by the site administrators.

The app uses a main component called `WikiPage` for all pages that ensure uniform design and navigation. This component also exposes the sidebar control, which is used to toggle the sidebar on small screens.

- The site has a main landing page, which lists all available articles, with the history of the last visited articles.
- Article page contains the article content, and a form for submitting new articles.
- The contribution form has a special name verifier that checks the name of the article against the database for uniqueness.
- A search page is available for searching for articles.
- WikiPage component has a modular system for different layouts, with the options for disabling the sidebar, panel, and the buttons and navigation available on the navbar.
- Usage of document.documentElement (html element) was required for dark theme toggle and offcanvas padding toggle, only css classes and attributes were added/removed.
- Login system is not implemented, but some of the UI elements are still visible.
